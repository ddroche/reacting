# Reacting

This project shows how to render a React app within an Angular app.

## Typescript

In order for this to compile properly, the `JSX` flag must be set to react

```
"jsx": "react"
```

## Reference

This projects follows the general practice described within an article written by [GoodData.UI](https://sdk.gooddata.com/gooddata-ui/docs/4.1.1/ht_use_react_component_in_angular_2.x.html).

## Additional Considerations

This project does not implement any ways for data to pass between the Angular app and the React app.  That will be left up to any future developers.

# Angular Wrapper

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
